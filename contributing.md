# We would love your contribution!

The best thing is to always file an issue before submitting a pull-request. This is not a requirement, but a general best practice. This makes it easier to discuss the issue before any code is written. Sometimes the issues might already be fixed or will be out of scope for the module.

# Pull requests

* merge all commits into on single commit for the pull request
* do not alter the version number, this is done in the release process

### Adding new stuff

1. All new components should reside in separate folders
1. The component you created should be added to the CSS file which bundles everything in core/components/thirdparty


### Quality checklist

1. You CSS code must work for all screen-sizes
1. Your widget should work in all browsers
1. Follow design the [principles of Object Oriented CSS](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/)

## Code Style Guide

If possible use the _.editorconfig_ file in the project as it automates the rule [see [EditorConfig.org](http://editorconfig.org/)]. Below is a summary:

* code should be indented with 4 spaces
* double quotes should be used where feasible
